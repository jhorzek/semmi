Description: Modification indices are commonly used in structural equation models (SEM)
             to post-hoc improve the fit. This practice has been criticized for
             capitalization on chance (i.e., overfitting). semmi (SEM modification
             indices) provides bootstrapped or cross-validated modification indices 
             to evaluate the stability of added modifications.
